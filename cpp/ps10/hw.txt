1) Create a base class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type string ), number of
cylinders in the engine (type int ), and owner (type Person given in the code that follows). Then
create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has additional properties, the load
capacity in tons (type double since it may contain a fractional part) and towing capacity in
pounds (type int ). Be sure your classes have a reasonable complement of constructors and
accessor methods, an overloaded assignment operator, and a copy constructor. Write a driver
program that tests all your methods. The definition of the class Person follows. The
implementation of the class is part of this programming project.
class Person
{
public:
Person( );
Person(string theName);
Person(const Person& theObject);
string getName( ) const;
Person& operator=(const Person& rtSide);
friend istream& operator >>(istream& inStream,
Person& personObject);
friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& outStream,
const Person& personObject);
private:
string name;
};

2) Define a class named Payment that contains a member variable of type float that stores the
amount of the payment and appropriate accessor and mutator functions. Also create a member
function named paymentDetails that outputs an English sentence describing the amount of the
payment.
Next, define a class named CashPayment that is derived from Payment . This class should
redefine the paymentDetails function to indicate that the payment is in cash. Include appropriate
constructor(s). Define a class named CreditCardPayment that is derived from Payment . This
class should contain member variables for the name on the card, expiration date, and credit card
number. Include appropriate constructor(s). Finally, redefine the paymentDetails function to
include all credit card information in the printout. Create a main function that creates at least
two CashPayment and two CreditCardPayment objects with different values and calls to
paymentDetails for each.

3) Define a class named Document that contains a member variable of type string named text that
stores any textual content for the document. Create a function named getText that returns the
text field, a way to set this value, and an overloaded assignment operator.
Next, define a class for Email that is derived from Document and that includes member
variables for the sender , recipient , and title of an e-mail message. Implement appropriate
accessor and mutator functions. The body of the e-mail message should be stored in the
inherited variable text . Also overload the assignment operator for this class.
Similarly, define a class for File that is derived from Document and that includes a member
variable for the pathname. Implement appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the
pathname and overload the assignment operator.
Finally, create several sample objects of type Email and File in your main function. Test your
objects by passing them to the following subroutine, which will return true if the object contains
the specified keyword in the text property.
bool ContainsKeyword( const Document& docObject, string keyword)
{
if (docObject.getText().find(keyword) != string::npos)
return true;
return false;
}
For example, you might test to see whether an e-mail message contains the text "c++" with the
call ContainsKeyword(emailObj, "c++"); .
